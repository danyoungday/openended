Given a video of a reinforcement learning agent's performance on a complex environment, design a new reward function to help the agent improve.

The details of the environment are as follows:
The environment is a grid world with walls, keys, doors, and goal squares.
This environment has a key that the agent must pick up in order to unlock a door and then get to the green goal square.
The actions the agent can take are:
    left: turn left
    right: turn right
    forward: move forward
    pickup: pick up object
    drop: drop object
    toggle: toggle/activate object
    done: unused
The only reward the agent currently receives is 1 - 0.9*t for reaching the goal square, where t is the number of steps it took to reach the goal square.

Explain what you saw the agent do in the video that led to design this reward, and how this reward will help the agent improve.
